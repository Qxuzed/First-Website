    <h1>Velociraptor</h1>
    <p>The Velociraptor lived in Asia, specifically the Mongolan area around 71-75 million years ago. This human sized beast could reach up to 6ft long from the snout all the way to the tip of the tail. The Velociraptor was a vicious carnivore that hunted in packs of up to 6 or more. They may have been small, but with a pack of decent size, they could take down very large predators such as the T-rex or the Spinosaurus; similar to wolves. </p>
